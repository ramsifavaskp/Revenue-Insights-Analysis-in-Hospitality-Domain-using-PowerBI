# 🏨 Revenue Insights Analysis in Hospitality Domain

This project focuses on analyzing key revenue metrics for the hospitality industry using Power BI. The goal is to provide actionable insights to optimize performance across various properties and booking platforms by transforming raw data into interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## 📊 Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed key performance metrics such as:
- **RevPAR** (Revenue per Available Room)
- **ADR** (Average Daily Rate)
- **Occupancy %**
- **Realization %**

The Power BI dashboard allows dynamic filtering by city, room class, and time period, providing a user-friendly interface for exploring trends and comparing performance across multiple properties.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Dynamic filtering by city, room class, and time period for granular analysis.
- **Revenue Metrics Visualization**: Real-time insights into key KPIs such as RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %, and Realization %.
- **Platform Comparison**: Comparative analysis of realization % and ADR across various booking platforms.
- **Trend Analysis**: Visualization of performance trends over time to identify potential revenue optimization areas.
  
## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **Excel**: Used for data cleaning and transformation.
- **SQL**: For querying data from the database.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used for custom calculations and metrics within Power BI.

- **Data Source**: Due to privacy constraints, sample or anonymized data is used for this project.

## 📈 Key Insights
The dashboard helped uncover important insights, such as:
- Identifying performance shifts across properties and booking platforms.
- Highlighting the impact of ADR and RevPAR on overall revenue.
- Trends in occupancy rates and their correlation with revenue realization.
